The theme’s subtle styles are inspired by the diversity and versatility of birds: its typography is lightweight yet strong, its color palette is drawn from nature, and its layout elements sit gently on the page.\n\nThe true richness of Twenty Twenty-Two lies in its opportunity for customization. The theme is built to take advantage of the Site Editor features introduced in WordPress 5.9, which means that colors, typography, and the layout of every single page on your site can be customized to suit your vision. It also includes dozens of block patterns, opening the door to a wide range of professionally designed layouts in just a few clicks.\n\nWhether you’re building a single-page website, a blog, a business website, or a portfolio, Twenty Twenty-Two will help you create a site that is uniquely yours.\n\n== Changelog ==\n\n= 1.5 =\n* Released: August 8, 2023\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.5</a>\n\n= 1.4 =\n* Released: March 28, 2023\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.4</a>\n\n= 1.3 =\n* Released: November 1, 2022\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.3</a>\n\n= 1.2 =\n* Released: May 24, 2022\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.2</a>\n\n= 1.1 =\n* Released: February 22, 2022\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.1</a>\n\n= 1.0 =\n* Released: January 25, 2022\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-two-changelog/#Version_1.0</a>\n\n== Copyright ==\n\nTwenty Twenty-Two WordPress Theme, 2021-2023 WordPress.org\nTwenty Twenty-Two is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL.\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
